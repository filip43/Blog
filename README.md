## Improving the internet for the millions, with just a weekend

[HackCambridge](https://hackcambridge.com/) provided the perfect opportunity to invite my friends to visit Cambridge.

With flights from Poland to London for two of the team members booked, we starting discussing ideas for what would be our first Hackathon together. Our ideas ranged from trying to implement a decentralised ICO ([DAICO](https://ethresear.ch/t/explanation-of-daicos/465)) to controlling a VR world with a [Myo armband](https://www.myo.com/). 

As the event neared, Microsoft released a video of their [Seeing AI app](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2mC-NUAmMk) to announce their involvement as a keen sponsor. The video demonstrated how [Saqid Shaikh](https://twitter.com/saqibs), a visually impaired software developer at Microsoft, used the app he created, to convert a visual world into an audible experience. **It was incredible**. The app could describe kids playing Frisbee in the park, or allow him to read a menu. We could only imagine the impact it had on him and many others with visual impairments.

We knew we wanted to build on SeeingAI's fantastic work. We initially discussed building an Android app equivalent, possibly in conjunction with the Myo Armband for hands-free control. However, with five minutes to go before the hackathon started and much excitement, it dawned on us how much of the internet was still inaccessible to the visually impaired in this day and age. We were committed to solving a problem which affects [250+ million people worldwide](http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs282/en/) in the hope of having a true social impact

## The problem

People with visual impairments frequently rely on a Screen Reader to navigate the internet. The Screen Reader reads out the written content of each page. However, when the Screen Reader reaches an image it has to rely on the “alt tag” to provide a caption. For the majority of the internet these “alt tags” are either missing (think of any user-uploaded content such as Twitter or LinkedIn), superficial or inaccurate. To test out images for yourself: right click on an image, click inspect element and see what person with visual impairments hears!

> This affects millions of people every day.

_The Screen Reader would not pickup any details of this "Hot Job"_

## The solution

Once we had narrowed down the problem coming up with the solution was much easier. We decided we would bring automatic "alt-tag" generation to everyone on the internet, regardless of device.

To do this we would use a Chrome extension to scan through every image on the page lacking an "alt tag". For each image where the "alt tag" was missing, we would send the image URL to an Azure cloud function. The cloud function would check if we already had the "alt tag" saved and if so return it. If not, we would use the Microsoft's Cognitive Services Vision API to perform object recognition and generate the description to be added as the "alt tag". 

We split into pairs: Mateusz and I built the Chrome extension, and Filip and Marcin built the cloud function and connected it to the Cognitive Services API. We started programming at 2 pm and by 9 pm we already had a fully functional prototype. The speed, accuracy, and ease of integration with which the image descriptions were being generated would not have been possible just a few years ago. The extra time allowed us to link in three more APIs: facial recognition, emotion recognition and OCR (image to text), depending on what was in the image. This provided much more descriptive image captions.

### What's next?

We didn't want to stop after the hackathon finished! Determined to bring our tool to people all over the world we started to plan our the public launch. Working with UCL and the Global Disability Innovation Hub we are proud to announce we will be running a pilot study to confirm the efficacy of what we are building. If you are interested in hearing more please [register your interest](https://visualcognition.co/). Additionally, [Lee](https://twitter.com/lee_stott) and [Geoff](https://twitter.com/geoffhu), from Microsoft, have introduced us to the accessibility team at Microsoft who have provided crucial advice on how we can further develop our tool for maximum impact.

> We hope our Chrome extension will empower those with visual impairments to browse the web, without having to rely on others to create the "alt tags".
